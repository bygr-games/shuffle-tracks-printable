# Derailed!

Welcome Engineers, to Deadfur Canyon — a narrow passage that connects four towns of our kingdom. Each of you owns a train Company and you've been invited to participate in a contest to build tracks linking all four towns. The Company that arrives first will win the prize!

But oh jeopardy! Our builders in the next town were distracted playing _Space Kitties_ and they mixed up the positions of all our stations!

Now the track paths are all mixed up — and we must find a way to reach our destinations.

Nevertheless, you must endure! Build your tracks, use your opponents' paths wisely and outwit them by leading them into dead ends!

May the best Builder win!

## Contents

- 12 Station Track Cards (2 per color)
- 6 Player Tokens
- 90 Rail Cards

## Goal of the Game

Be the Company with most points after 3 rounds. Earn points by connecting to your Destination before the other players.

## Setup

<-- REFERENCE IMAGE -->

1. **Choose Company:** Each player selects a Company and takes the matching token
2. **Set Up Rail Deck:** Shuffle all Rail Cards and place them face down in a draw pile.
3. **Deal Rail Cards:** Each player draws 4 cards from the Rail Deck.
4. **Set Up Starting Column:** Shuffle one station card for each Player's Company and place them in a straight line.
5. **Set Up Destination Column:** Do the same with another set of station cards and place them in a line parallel to the Starting Column.

   - Leave space between the columns for the Railway Area — 4 Rail Cards long.
   - **Solving Conflicts:** Each lane (straight path between a start and destination station) must contain two different Companies. If a lane has the Company at both ends:

     - Swap the destination card with the destination of the next Company alphabetically.
     - Repeat until all lanes contain two different companies.

     Reference Company names: A, B, C, D, E, F

6. **Start the Game!:** In your first match, the player who most recently traveled by train starts. In later matches, the player with the fewest points from the previous match starts.

## Play Structure

- Players take turns in clockwise order.
- On your turn:
  1. Play one card from your hand into the Railway Area.
  2. Draw one card from the Rail Deck to refill your hand.
- If you've reached your destination, skip your turn and score 1 extra point instead.
- If the Rail Deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.

- **Round ends** when enough players have reached their Destination:

| Players | Reached Ends When... |
| ------- | :------------------: |
| 2       |      1 Arrives       |
| 3       |       2 Arrive       |
| 4       |       3 Arrive       |
| 5       |       3 Arrive       |
| 6       |       3 Arrive       |

## Placement Rules

- Played cards must have a connecting path to the player's Starting Station.
- Cards must be placed within the station lanes — not outside of them.
- Cards must be placed **longitudinally** (following the direction of the lane).
- Cards don't need to connect to every neighboring track — just to the one that leads to your Starting Station.
- Cards may be placed on top of others to overwrite previous tracks.
- Cards must fit neatly within grid slots — never between them.

## Scoring

- 1 Point: Reach your Destination
- 1 Extra Point: Be the first to arrive that Round
- 1 Extra Point: Each time your turn comes around after you've finished

## Starting a New Round

After a round ends, reset the board as follows:

1. **Remove all Rail Cards:** Move all Rail Cards from the Railway Area to a face up Discard Pile.
2. **Remove Starting Column:** Set aside the cards from the current Starting Column and shuffle them
3. **Swap Starting Column:** Move the Destination Column into the Starting Column's position
4. **Set Up New Destination Column:** Place the shuffled station cards from **Step 2** as the new Destination Column. If any lanes have the same Company at both ends, resolve conflicts using the **Setup -> Solving Conflicts** rules.
5. **Discard Cards:** Each player may discard up to 2 cards from their hand and draw replacements from the Rail Deck.
6. **Start**: The player who lost the last round goes first. If there is more than one, the one with fewer points starts. If there is still a tie — Rock, Paper, Scissors settles it.

## End of the Game

After 3 Rounds, hthe game ends. The player with most points wins the contest and is crowned as the best Railway Engineer of the Kingdom.
This moment will be remembered for ages to come... or at least until you start a new match.

## Godspeed!

Good luck! And remember:

> "A railroad is like a lie, you have to keep building it to make it stand."
