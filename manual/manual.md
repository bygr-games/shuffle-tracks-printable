# Derailed!

Welcome Engineers to Deadfur Canyon, a narrow passage that connects 4 towns of our kingdom. Each of you owns a train Company and you have all been invited to a contest to build train tracks to connect these 4 towns. The town who arrives sooner will with the prize!

But oh jeopardy! Our builders in the next town were distracted playing Space Kitties and they mixed the positioning of all our stations!

Now the track paths are all mixed up and we must arrive to destination somehow.

Nevertheless you must endure! Build your tracks, use your oponents paths efficiently and outwit them by forcing them to dead ends!

May the best Builder win!

## Content

- 12 Station Colour Tracks
- 6 Player Tokens
- 90 Rail Cards

## Goal of the Game

Be the Company with most points after 3 rounds. Make points by connecting to your Destination before the other players.

## Setup

1. **Choose Company:** Each player chooses a Company and takes the respective token
2. **Setup Rail Deck:** Take all Rail Cards, shuffle them and place them face down in a pile.
3. **Deal Rail Cards:** From the Rail Deck, deal 4 cards to each player.
4. **Setup Starting Column:** Take one station card per player Company, shuffle them, and place them one after other in a straight line
5. **Setup Destination Column:** Take another station card per player Company, suffle them and, and place them one after other in a straight line.

   - Remember to leave space for the Railway Area, it needs to be as long as 4 Rail Cards.
   - **Solving Conflicts:** Lanes must always have different companies at Starting and Destination. If a lane has the same Starting and Destination Company:

     - Swap the destination card from that lane with the destination card of the next Company who is playing in alphabetical order.
     - Do this until there are no more conflicts and all lanes have an origin and a destination with different companies.

     For reference: This are the Company names: A, B, C, D, E, F

6. **Start the Game!:** On your first match, yhe player who took a train most recently starts. After that, the player who made fewer points in the last match, starts.

## Play Structure

- Players play taking turns to play in a Clockwise fashion.
- During the their turn each player takes one card from its hand and places it in the Railway Area. Then, the player takes one card from the Rail Deck and places it in its hand.
- If the player has arrived to its destination, when it's its turn, instead of playing, the player scores one extra point.
- If the Rail Deck runs out, setup a new one by shuffling the discard pile, and placing it face down.

- The round ends when most of the players have arrived to the Destination:

| Players | Reached Destination |
| ------- | :-----------------: |
| 2       |          1          |
| 3       |          2          |
| 4       |          3          |
| 5       |          3          |
| 6       |          3          |

## Placement Rules

- Played cards must have a connecting path to the player's Starting Station.
- Cards must be placed within the lanes where there are stations, cards are not allowed outside of the station lanes.
- Cards must always be played "longitudinally" in relation to the lane.
- Cards don't need to connect to all neighboring tracks, only to the one who takes you to the Station
- Cards can replace previous cards by playing them on top of previous ones.
- Cards must be placed within a grid, they cannot be between grid slots.

- 1 Point for Arriving to your Destination
- 1 Extra Point for being the First to Arrive this Round
- 1 Extra Point for each time it's your turn after you arrived to your Destination

## New Round

After a Round is over, we reset the board:

1. **Remove all Rail Cards:** Take all Rail Cards from the Railway Area and place them face up in a Discard Pile.
2. **Remove Starting Column:** Set aside the cards from the starting column and shuffle them
3. **Swap Starting Column:** Move the Destination Column and place it in the Starting Column
4. **Setup Destination Column:** Take the station card that you recently set aside and place them in the Destination Column. In case of conflicts, solve them using the rules detailed in **Setup -> Solving Conflicts**

After 3 Rounds have been played, the game ends and the player with most points wins.

## Godspeed!

Good luck! And remember:
